Virtual Financial Advisor

I started this repository because I wanted to create a bundle of tools that I could use to evaluate and predict a stock.

RandomForestClass stock predict: 
Uses: pandas, sklearn, yfinance, matplotlib

ValueCalculator:

What does it do: It pulls info from yahoo finance to show all of the basic stock evaluations.

LSTM stock predict:
Uses: numpy, matplotlib, yfinance, sklearn, tensorflow
